# Repeator

Repeator is an audio plugin that allows you to play a sound repeatedly after a given time. It's designed for adding noise or your copyright statement easily to your track before sending it to the client.

The current version offers several built-in choices including **silence**, **white noise**, and **sine tone beep**. You can also load any short audio files of your own from the menu "load..." or simply drag and drop the file into the window.
