# Repeator

Repeator is an audio plugin allowing you to play a given sound repeatedly after a period of time. It's designed for quickly adding noise or the copyright statement to your tracks before sending them to the clients.

The current version offers several built-in choices including **silence**, **white noise**, and **sine tone beep**. You can also load any audio files of your own from the menu "load..." or simply drag and drop the file into the window.
