# Repeator

Repeator is an audio plugin allowing you to play a given sound repeatedly after a period of time. It's designed for quickly adding noise or the copyright statement to your tracks before sending them to the clients.

Watch the demo video at [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/741322714) or [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nB4y1z7MP).

Repeator offers several built-in choices including **silence**, **white noise**, and **sine tone beep**. You can also load any audio files of your own from the menu "load..." or simply drag and drop the file into the window. Reaptor also supports multiple languages.

Windows is not supported as for right now. I just need a Windows environment to compile the plugin.
